        For a fast and flowy mountain biking experience based on the trail descriptions provided, I recommend the following trails:

1. Schultz Creek Trail

This trail offers a smooth ride with playful features like berms and opportunities to get a bit of air. It's known for its flow and is a popular choice among bikers looking for a fast ride. However, be aware of hikers, bikers, and dog walkers on the trail.
2. Schultz Pass Loop

Similar to Schultz Creek Trail, this loop includes flowing trails with berms and fun descents while providing a moderate workout. Itâ€™s a good choice for those looking for a bit of a challenge without exhausting themselves, perfect for maintaining momentum and speed.
3. Two Lost Souls Loop

This trail features a thrilling downhill section along Schultz Creek, ideal for those looking to enjoy a fast descent through scenic surroundings. It combines a variety of terrain, making the ride exciting and enjoyable.
4. Flagstaff Loop Trail: West to Fort Tuthill

Offering semi-flowy singletrack that includes some smooth sections perfect for a fast ride. The trail passes through beautiful landscapes and is well-suited for those looking for a relatively easy ride with bits of challenge.
5. Cosnino Loop

This is another trail that combines flowing sections through forests with wide-open views and tunnel crossings, offering a somewhat adventurous ride that remains fast and enjoyable.
These trails are well-su
